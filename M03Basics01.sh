# 'wget' is a command-line tool to download files. Your task is to use this command to download
# text from a given URL.
#
# You can give wget just the url (ie, 'wget https://www.google.com') but like most command line
# programs wget has many options.
#
# For this exercise, you should give wget an option to change the name of the file. This
# is -O (capital letter o) followed by the filename. Or you can use the long option --output-document.
#
# Here is the URL to download: https://bit.ly/38cpLXk
# The file should be stored as msse_gist.txt
#
# You can run the test for this exercise by executing the following command in your terminal:
# bash tests/test_M03.sh
